Since the worst thing you can do to programmers as a compiler writer is to
generate an incorrect program from a semantically correct program, we decided
not to make any failing tests for this assignment.

In the passing folder, there are a few categories of tests:
expressions, functions, statements, and storage (really a sub category
of functions.)

Each test in the folder assumes parts of the language works (like if statments,
put statements) to simplify test writing, but also tests a specific part of the
language.
